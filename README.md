Course work for the course, which is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fcode-challenges-javascript%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url%26shareId%3Dubsi0nHLTo6j4PbTlbSTSw%253D%253D)

### NB

I'm not a premium member, so I didn't download the starter files.

I didn't make an HTML file for every single example. The ones without an HTML I simply ran `$ node {file}` to see the results in the terminal.

And finally, _(most of)_ these are my attempts at the code before viewing the result, so they're not as clean as the instructor's code. If you want the "real" answers, you'll have to watch and learn.
